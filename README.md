## Game Setup

1. Download the latest version [Click Me!](https://github.com/AnioDevs/chamber-experiment/releases)

2. Double left click on the file you downloaded. (It should open automatically in Roblox Studio. If it doesn't, reinstall Roblox Studio or try opening Roblox Studio and dragging the file into Roblox Studio. If it doesn't work, contact us or Roblox support.)

3. Publish your game and go to Game Settings --> Security tab and enable these two settings otherwise you will encounter many errors. The settings that need to be enabled are: Allow HTTP Requests and Enable Studio Access to API Services . Information about these two settings is available below.

# Explanations

## Roblox Game Security Settings

### Allow HTTP Requests

- You can make your game send HTTP requests so you can easily do things like save data to 3rd Party Databases. (For example: MongoDB, Supabase etc.)

### Enable Studio Access to API Services

- That setting that is open in every game. You provide easy access to the Roblox API. It allows you to use the DataStore system. So you can save simple data of the player such as Money, XP, Level, Open Characters, Open Perks.
